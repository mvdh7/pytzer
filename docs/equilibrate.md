# Solving equilibria

There are two 'layers' of solver in Pytzer: stoichiometric and thermodynamic.

The stoichiometric solver determines the molality of each solute given a set of total molalities and fixed stoichiometric equilibrium constants.  It uses a Newton-Raphson iterative method that is fully compatible with JAX.

The thermodynamic solver wraps the stoichiometric solver and adjusts the stoichiometric equilibrium constants to agree with thermodynamic constraints.  Because it uses [`scipy.optimize.root`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.root.html), it cannot be yet[^1] differentiated or compiled with JAX.

[^1]: We are planning to merge the two solvers together, making the entire program grad-able and jit-able by JAX, in a future release.

You can solve equilibria using the following functions.  Lower-level approaches with more fine control are possible, but not yet documented.

## Solve a single solution

You can solve a single solution for equilibrium using `pz.solve`:

```python
solutes, pks_constants = pz.solve(
    totals,
    exclude_equilibria=None,
    ks_constants=None,
    ks_only=None,
    library=Seawater,
    pressure=10.10325,
    temperature=298.15,
    verbose=False,
)
```

### Arguments

  * `totals` is an `OrderedDict` of the total molality of each group of components in the solution.  Non-equilibrating components are included too.  Equilibrating components are grouped as follows:
    * `totals["CO2"]` = sum of all carbonate species.
    * `totals["PO4"]` = sum of all phosphate species.
    * `totals["F"]` = sum of all fluoride species.
    * `totals["SO4"]` = sum of all sulfate species.
    * `totals["BOH3"]` = sum of all borate species.
    * `totals["NH3"]` = sum of all ammonia species.
    * `totals["H2S"]` = sum of all sulfide species.
    * `totals["NO2"]` = sum of all nitrite species.
    * `totals["H4SiO4"]` = sum of all silicate species.
    * `totals["Mg"]` = sum of all magnesium species.
    * `totals["Ca"]` = sum of all calcium species.
    * `totals["Sr"]` = sum of all strontium species.
  * `exclude_equilibria` allows you to list equilibria that will not be included in the model.
  * `ks_constants` allows you to provide your own initial-guess values of the stoichiometric equilibrium constants, as a `dict`.
  * `ks_only` allows you to list equilibria for which the thermodyamic constants are not used (i.e. the initial stoichiometric constants are kept constant).
  * `library` is the [`ParameterLibrary`](../libraries/#parameter-libraries) that you want to use.
  * `pressure` is the pressure in dbar.
  * `temperature` is the temperature in K.
  * `verbose` controls how much information is sent to stdout.

### Results

  * `solutes` is an `OrderedDict` of the molality of each component at thermodynamic equilibrium.
  * `ks_constants` is a `dict` of the stoichiometric equilibrium constants at thermodynamic equilibrium.

## Solve a pandas DataFrame

You can put the `totals` described above into columns of a pandas DataFrame (`df`), add columns for `"temperature"` (in K) and `"pressure"` (in dbar) if needed, and then solve all the rows in the DataFrame with `pz.solve_df`:

```python
pz.solve_df(
    df,
    exclude_equilibria=None,
    inplace=True,
    ks_only=None,
    library=Seawater,
    verbose=False,
)
```
